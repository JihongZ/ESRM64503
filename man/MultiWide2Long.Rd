\title{A function that reshapes data from wide format to long format
when multiple variables are present.}
\usage{
MultiWide2Long(
  data,
  idvars,
  varlist,
  timevals = 1:length(varlist[[1]]),
  timevar = "time"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that is wide format.}

\item{idvars}{The id variable(s) that identify multiple records from the
same unit.}

\item{varlist}{A list of length equal to the number of variables to be
reshaped from wide to long. The names of the elements will make up the
names of the new long-format variables. Each element of the list is a
character vector that contains the variable names in data that are to
be reshaped. All elements must have character vectors of the same length.}

\item{timevals}{A vector of numbers to use for time. Length must be equal
to the size of the elements in varlist. Can be NA for no time.}

\item{timevar}{A character containing the name of the new time variable.
Can be NA for default name or no name if timevar is NA.}
}
\value{
A data frome in long format
}
\description{
Used for reshaping data more extensively than the \code{reshape},
\code{melt}, or \code{reshape2} functions available. Can reshape multiple
wide-format variables into long format.
